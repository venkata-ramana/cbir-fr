## Content Based Image Retrieval and Face Recognition
"Content-based" means that the search analyzes the contents of the image rather than the metadata such as keywords, tags, or descriptions associated with the image. The term "content" in this context might refer to colors, shapes, textures, or any other information that can be derived from the image itself. CBIR is desirable because searches that rely purely on metadata are dependent on annotation quality and completeness. Having humans manually annotate images by entering keywords or metadata in a large database can be time consuming and may not capture the keywords desired to describe the image. The evaluation of the effectiveness of keyword image search is subjective and has not been well-defined. In the same regard, CBIR systems have similar challenges in defining success. 

##Facial Recognition:
It recognize faces and will consider more factors like distance between two eyes, eyes to nose, nose to mouth.., etc. Here we firstly upload the image to which we want the similar outputs. Then the detection of an image and recognizing its objects from the image etc are done. All these together give us a relevant output.

##How it works?
